                <p> You are sitting in front of your computer. You have just installed this new game you were told about called "Life.exe."</p>
                <p>The window loads open to a blank white screen with a black shillouetted figure standing there. What do you do?</p>
                <p><a href="#2"> RESET</a> Maybe the game loaded wrong?</p>

                <p> You close the window to "Life.exe" and re-open it. When the window opens, you are greeted with the exact same image.</p>
                <p>However, something is different... it seems as though the dark figure now has eyes and they are now staring at you.</p>
                <p><a href="#4"> RESET AGAIN</a> Third time's a charm maybe?</p>
                <p><a href="#5"> TURN OFF PC</a> Maybe come back to it later?</p>

                <p> You press the right arrow key. The figure does not have a walk animation, but you get the feeling he is actually moving.</p>
                <p>Eventually a crudely-drawn door shows up, and the figure walks through it. Nothing seems to happen.</p>
                <p>You close the window, and you find the dark figure is not standing on your desktop. what do you do?</p>
                <p><a href="#6"> DELETE LIFE.EXE</a>This is messed up... maybe deleting the file will fix it?</p>
