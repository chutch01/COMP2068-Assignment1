                <p> You close the window to "Life.exe" and re-open it. When the window opens, you are greeted with the exact same image.</p>
                <p>However, something is different... it seems as though the dark figure now has eyes and they are now staring at you.</p>

                <p>Eventually a crudely-drawn door shows up, and the figure walks through it. Nothing seems to happen.</p>
                <p>You close the window, and you find the dark figure is now standing on your desktop. what do you do?</p>
